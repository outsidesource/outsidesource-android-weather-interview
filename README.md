# Outside Source Weather App

## Abstract
We designed this coding exercise to help us see how you would structure a new Android application and how well you can implement a design. We understand your time is valuable. For that reason, no part of this exam is required. With that said, the more you complete, the better we'll be able to assess your skill.

## Implementation Goals
* Separation of concerns
* Demonstrate extensible/scalable patterns
* UI implementation accuracy

## Implementation Notes
* At Outside Source, all new applications use JetPack Compose. Please implement the UI using JetPack Compose.
* The City/State input can accept any text.
* Clicking the "Get Forecast" button may return the same results every time.
* Treat the "Get Forecast" button as fetching from a API (which may be a mock).
